Life changes

I'm back, after a long time without write something here! It is not secret for
anyone that I have more fun hacking the `blog engine`_ that moves this blog
than writing blog posts for it, but I'll try to keep a decent frequency of
posts from now.

My life changed heavily this year, and looks like it will still change a bit
more.

I changed my job. I'm now working for Collabora_, an awesome open source
consulting company. I'm also slowly recovering my Gentoo_ activity and planning
to restart working on some of the projects that were abandoned due to some
"restrictions" of my old job.

I'm also facing some personal problems, but I don't want to talk about them
here. I think that everything will get better soon. :)

&lt;p&gt;This year I helped the &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;http://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Google_Summer_of_Code/2013&quot;&gt;Gentoo GSoC&lt;/a&gt; project as a mentor for the first time! I
mentored Jauhien Piatlicki, that worked on the g-sorcery project, that is a
framework for automated ebuild generators. It is meant to replace g-octave
and some of the other Gentoo automated ebuild generators in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those who don't know, &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2013&quot;&gt;Google Summer of Code&lt;/a&gt; is a Google program that
pays a student to work during 3 months on an open source project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been using Scrum at work for some time already, and asked Jauhien about
trying to use it in our project. We agreed on using it wherever it made sense
for our workflow. In other words, we adapted Scrum to our workflow, instead of
adapt our workflow to Scrum. That's because none of us was a Scrum expert, and
because we needed to follow Gentoo/Google guidelines and timeline during all
the project, making it hard to apply some aspects of the Scrum methodologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had sprints of 2 weeks, starting on monday, after a quick planning on IRC.
We had a private IRC channel at Freenode, where we discussed stuff, had
meetings, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had sprints of 2 weeks, starting on monday, after a quick planning on IRC.
We had a private IRC channel at Freenode, where we discussed stuff, had
meetings, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- read_more --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We didn't had daily meetings. We were on very different timezones, and it was
quite hard to meet daily. We just used the other tools and our IRC channel to
fill the gap left by the daily meetings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We created a kanban board, using &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;http://trello.com/&quot;&gt;Trello&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://trello.com/b/8WdY2ZIs/framework-for-automated-ebuild-generators&quot;&gt;https://trello.com/b/8WdY2ZIs/framework-for-automated-ebuild-generators&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This board and the IRC channel were our main management tools, and both worked
pretty well. The board cards were used for stories and the card checklists were
used for the tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the first planning meeting we estimated all the backlog, to know how
many points were required per sprint to keep the project on schedule, because we
had a hard timeline to accomplish. These estimatives were quite useful, because
everybody following the project was able to know if the work was evolving
properly or not. But estimating the backlog, to accomplish a timeline, isn't an
easy task, it requires good knowledge of the stories and about how everything
will be implemented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the other planning meetings we just calculated how many points were
done in the previous sprint and choose stories for the next sprint, replacing the
stories already finished. I let Jauhien choose the stories he wanted to include
in the sprints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our methodology was proven efficient right before the GSoC mid-term evaluation.
All the stories planned to be finished before the evaluation were done, showing
that the work was evolving like planned and that our estimatives were good enough.
We were already confident on this, because all the sprints before the evaluation
were finished in time. :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Same thing before the final evaluation. All the required stories were finished!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We both had several problems during the project, but the tools made it easy to track
the current state of the project easily by looking at the kanban board, at the
source repository or just asking on IRC. Knowing the status of the project allowed
us to focus the efforts on getting the tasks done, while still handling our personal
problems in parallel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post isn't intended to be a Scrum tutorial or something like that. I just
wanted to share the experience of using these methodologies during a GSoC project.
We just adapted Scrum to our workflow, as said before. Don't be too picky! :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is just a quick (and late) post about FISL 13, that happened at Porto
Alegre/RS, Brazil, from July 25th to 28th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a really cool conference, and I had the first chance to meet another
Collaboran (Thiago Santos), and lots of people that I just knew from the
Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had an activity in the schedule. It was a talk/BoF about Google Summer of
Code, with some discussions and lightning talks about the projects developed
by the present students and mentors. I presented an introduction about the
Google Summer of Code and moderated the discussions and lightning talks. Pretty
cool! :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to my employer &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;http://www.collabora.com/&quot;&gt;Collabora&lt;/a&gt; for sponsoring

&lt;p&gt;The first task of my &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/infrastructure/distpatch/&quot;&gt;GSoC project&lt;/a&gt; was to add XZ support to diffball,
that is a tool that generates binary deltas for tarballs and binaries
in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;diffball is versioned using &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;http://git-scm.com/&quot;&gt;Git&lt;/a&gt;, that isn't something I like, personally.
I usually do &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;http://git-scm.com/&quot;&gt;Git&lt;/a&gt; in the same way as I do CVS and other centralized version
control systems, resulting in a bad patch series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I don't know how to rework patches properly with &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;http://git-scm.com/&quot;&gt;Git&lt;/a&gt;, I did it using
&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/MqExtension&quot;&gt;Mercurial Queues&lt;/a&gt; that are something I know better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I needed 2 extensions, &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;http://hg-git.github.com/&quot;&gt;hg-git&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/MqExtension&quot;&gt;mq&lt;/a&gt;.

summary:     update copyright/license specifics

...
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My commits are 447:451. I need to convert them to mq patches, after
initialize the mq repository:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;literal-block&quot;&gt;
$ hg init --mq
$ hg qimport --git -r 447:451
$ hg qseries
447.diff
448.diff
449.diff
450.diff
451.diff
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I have 5 patches, with the local revision number as name. They are applied to
the original repository by default. I need to remove them before start re-adding
each one in the correct order:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;literal-block&quot;&gt;
$ hg qpop -a
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;reworking-the-patches&quot;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Reworking the patches&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I fixed a typo in the code that enable the dcbuffer debug. It's the 4th patch
in the original queue. As this patch isn't related to the XZ support I'm
implementing itself, I'll move it to the begin of the queue and rename it to
something better than the local revision number:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;literal-block&quot;&gt;
$ hg qpush --move 450.diff
applying 450.diff
now at: 450.diff
$ hg qmv 450.diff fixed-typo-when-enabling-dcbuffer-debug.diff
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patches &lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;447.diff&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;449.diff&lt;/tt&gt; are related. I decided that I should
use the XZ name instead of LZMA, and changed the code of the first patch.
These 2 patches should be unified, creating a new patch:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;literal-block&quot;&gt;
$ patch -p1 &amp;lt; .hg/patches/447.diff
patching file include/cfile.h
patching file libcfile/cfile.c
$ patch -p1 &amp;lt; .hg/patches/449.diff
patching file include/cfile.h
patching file libcfile/cfile.c
$ hg qnew --git --currentuser --currentdate -m &amp;quot;added XZ auto-detection support.&amp;quot; added-xz-autodetection-support.diff
$ hg qdelete 447.diff 449.diff
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;.hg/patches&lt;/tt&gt; is the &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;http://mercurial.selenic.com/&quot;&gt;Mercurial&lt;/a&gt; repository that the extension uses to store
the patches. It was created by the &lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;hg init &lt;span class=&quot;pre&quot;&gt;--mq&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; command.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patch &lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;448.diff&lt;/tt&gt; is ok, I'll just re-add it and rename:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;literal-block&quot;&gt;
$ hg qpush 448.diff
applying 448.diff
now at: 448.diff
$ hg qmv 448.diff added-liblzma-build-system-checks-using-pkgconfig.diff
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last unnaplied patch I have is &lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;451.diff&lt;/tt&gt;, that is good, but the commit
message isn't ok. I'll re-add it, change the commit message and rename it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;literal-block&quot;&gt;
$ hg qpush 451.diff
applying 451.diff
now at: 451.diff
$ hg qrefresh -m &amp;quot;added XZ functionality to libcfile.&amp;quot;
$ hg qmv 451.diff added-xz-functionality-to-libcfile.diff
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point I have a &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;http://mercurial.selenic.com/&quot;&gt;Mercurial&lt;/a&gt; queue with the 4 reworked patches inside
&lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;.hg/patches&lt;/tt&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;literal-block&quot;&gt;
$ hg qseries
fixed-typo-when-enabling-dcbuffer-debug.diff
added-xz-autodetection-support.diff
added-liblzma-build-system-checks-using-pkgconfig.diff
added-xz-functionality-to-libcfile.diff
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commit the queue changes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;literal-block&quot;&gt;
$ hg commit --mq -m &amp;quot;added queue&amp;quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can publish it somewhere using the command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;literal-block&quot;&gt;
$ hg push --mq $REMOTE_REPO_URL
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My repository is here (broken url):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;http://hg.rafaelmartins.eng.br/mq/diffball&quot;&gt;http://hg.rafaelmartins.eng.br/mq/diffball&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This howto is far from perfect. I just wanted to give a quick introdution
for people that want to get started with this cool feature of &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;http://mercurial.selenic.com/&quot;&gt;Mercurial&lt;/a&gt;. :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last night I participated of the third edition of Google OSS Jam, that happened
at the offices of &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;http://www.google.com/&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; in São Paulo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The event was very cool, and a nice opportunity to meet other people highly
interested in open source software and nerdy stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time I talked about my current GSoC project: &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/project/google/gsoc2011/rafael_martins/21001&quot;&gt;Distfile patching support&lt;/a&gt;
for Gentoo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was not so clear as I expected, but I think that people understood what I
&lt;em&gt;tried&lt;/em&gt; to say. :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slides (in Brazilian Portuguese) are here:

&lt;p&gt;Last night I participated of the third edition of Google OSS Jam, that happened
at the offices of &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;http://www.google.com/&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; in São Paulo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The event was very cool, and a nice opportunity to meet other people highly
interested in open source software and nerdy stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time I talked about my current GSoC project: &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/project/google/gsoc2011/rafael_martins/21001&quot;&gt;Distfile patching support&lt;/a&gt;
for Gentoo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was not so clear as I expected, but I think that people understood what I
&lt;em&gt;tried&lt;/em&gt; to say. :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slides (in Brazilian Portuguese) are here:

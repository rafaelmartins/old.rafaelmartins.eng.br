&lt;p&gt;This is just a quick (and late) post about FISL 13, that happened at Porto
Alegre/RS, Brazil, from July 25th to 28th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a really cool conference, and I had the first chance to meet another
Collaboran (Thiago Santos), and lots of people that I just knew from the
Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had an activity in the schedule. It was a talk/BoF about Google Summer of
Code, with some discussions and lightning talks about the projects developed
by the present students and mentors. I presented an introduction about the
Google Summer of Code and moderated the discussions and lightning talks. Pretty
cool! :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to my employer &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;http://www.collabora.com/&quot;&gt;Collabora&lt;/a&gt; for sponsoring
the trip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some weeks ago I decided to restart working with PIC microcontrollers, just for fun,
and bought some electronic components, tools, etc. After having everything in hands,
I started looking at the state of the PIC development tools in Gentoo, and found some
outdated packages. I updated the packages I wanted to use (&lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pre&quot;&gt;dev-embedded/gputils&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;
and &lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pre&quot;&gt;dev-embedded/gpsim&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;; &lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pre&quot;&gt;dev-embedded/sdcc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; still needs some work), and added
some other packages (&lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pre&quot;&gt;dev-embedded/cpik&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;, a C compiler for PIC 18F, and re-added
&lt;tt class=&quot;docutils literal&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pre&quot;&gt;dev-embedded/pikdev&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;, a simple graphic IDE for the development of PIC-based
applications, that was previously removed due to the usage of kdelibs3, and now is a
Qt4-only application).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll be putting some effort on packaging the MPLAB X IDE and the XC8 compiler in the
next weeks, if permitted by their licenses. I'm not sure yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's all for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although I'm relatively busy with my work to improve &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;/en-us/tag/lua/&quot;&gt;Lua on Gentoo&lt;/a&gt; I need to
update you about my main role: sci-electronics. Actually, the Gentoo Electronics
subproject right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On October 17 the developers from the sci-electronics herd had a meeting to
discuss the state of the herd and the creation of a subproject. At the end of
the meeting I was elected the lead of this subproject, and now I should stop
slacking and start doing something to make the &amp;quot;Soldering Iron Brotherhood&amp;quot;
move ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/science/electronics/&quot;&gt;subproject page&lt;/a&gt; was created by me, based on a work of Denis (Calchan),
with some help of Thomas (TomJBE) and is already online (not listed on the
Science page because its not done yet):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/science/electronics/&quot;&gt;http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/science/electronics/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently we have 2 main tasks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recruit new developers: We need more developers to take care of the
electronics-related stuff. New blood is never enough. ;) I still can't
mentoring anyone to join Gentoo as developer, but I'm sure that some senior
developer will be glad to help you join the team if you are really interested.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write test benches: Electronics software is kinda esoteric. Arch testers
usually are not specialists, then we should provide good test benches to
make their life easier when stabilizing our packages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's all for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feel free to contact me and stay tuned! :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is just a quick (and late) post about FISL 13, that happened at Porto
Alegre/RS, Brazil, from July 25th to 28th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a really cool conference, and I had the first chance to meet another
Collaboran (Thiago Santos), and lots of people that I just knew from the
Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had an activity in the schedule. It was a talk/BoF about Google Summer of
Code, with some discussions and lightning talks about the projects developed
by the present students and mentors. I presented an introduction about the
Google Summer of Code and moderated the discussions and lightning talks. Pretty
cool! :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to my employer &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;http://www.collabora.com/&quot;&gt;Collabora&lt;/a&gt; for sponsoring
the trip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week I have been attending to the LinuxCon Brazil 2010, that was the first
edition of this event here in Brazil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the talks were pretty good and the event was a great oportunity to meet nice
people, good projects and learn some cool stuff (and get an &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;http://files.rafaelmartins.eng.br/img/autograph_linus.jpg&quot;&gt;autograph of Linus
Torvalds&lt;/a&gt; as well :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately the Gentoo presence in the event was null. Well, not really null
because I was there, but it seems that the Brazilian users are not very
interested in Gentoo and I'm not sure if someone will be able to change this
some day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe I'll write more stuff about the LinuxCon soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned! ;)&lt;/p&gt;

help me to forcing the old creation date, instead of the date of the
first commit on the new repository. --&gt;

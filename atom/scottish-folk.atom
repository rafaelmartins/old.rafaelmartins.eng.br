&lt;p&gt;A few months ago, following the indication of some friend, I subscribed to
&lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.calmradio.com/&quot;&gt;Calm Radio&lt;/a&gt;. It is a nice web service, where you pay a few dollars per
month and have access to several streaming channels, with random songs from
different music styles being played, and you can even mix the songs with
some atmospheres, like storm, forest, wind and others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have tried almost all the available channels, and ended up choosing the
Celtic channel as my favorite one. I used to work listening to it every day
(while I had an internet connection at work, but this doesn't matters now
;). This is how I got introduced to the fantastic world of the Celtic music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this post is about &lt;a class=&quot;reference external&quot; href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silly_Wizard&quot;&gt;Silly Wizard&lt;/a&gt;, I was just introducing the topic.
Silly Wizard was a well-known Scottish folk band, active from 1970 to 1988.
I'm not going to talk about their history, but you're free for research. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can't remember exactly the first time I listened to a Silly Wizard song.
I think that some random song from the Celtic channel of Calm Radio got my
attention. I don't even remember who was playing the song (I think that
Calm Radio doesn't have Silly Wizard's albums on its playlists. I never
heard any song there, at least). I started looking for this song on
Google/Youtube, and found the &amp;quot;original&amp;quot; version, played by Silly Wizard.
The song was &lt;em&gt;Mo Chuachag Laghach&lt;/em&gt;, I guess, but I'm not sure. After this I
started researching about them, and found plenty of great songs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot; class=&quot;align-left&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/embed/appBtXoxfb8&quot; style=&quot;width: 425px; height: 344px;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd like to introduce a nice Silly Wizard's song for you, called
&lt;em&gt;Donald McGillavry&lt;/em&gt;. This song was released on the album &lt;em&gt;So Many Partings
(1979)&lt;/em&gt;, released again on the album &lt;em&gt;The best of Silly Wizard (1985)&lt;/em&gt;
and recorded live for the album &lt;em&gt;Live Wizardry (1988)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This video was recorded in a concert on April 1, 1988. I'm not sure if this
is the same concert that provided the audio tracks for &lt;em&gt;Live Wizardry&lt;/em&gt;, but
they are from the same season, at least. This concert happened a few days
before I born, and was probably one of the latest Silly Wizard concerts
before they broke up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope you enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;

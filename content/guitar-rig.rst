Guitar Rig
==========

I'm an amateur guitar player, learning how to play the electric guitar just for
fun.

This is the equipment that I use for my studies. It is all simple and cheap,
to be compatible with my skills. ;-)

Effects Pedals
--------------

Zoom G1Xon
``````````

This is a cheap Zoom effects pedal, with expression pedal, lots of pre-built
patches, amplifier emulators, chromatic tuner, looper, rhythm patterns, etc.
I use it most of the time, with my headphones, instead of using the amplifier.

Amplifiers
----------

```````````````

This is a 20W combo with (not so good) built-in overdrive.

Headphones
----------

Fortrek Blast DJ HP903
``````````````````````

This is a simple headphone with 3.5mm connector (and 6.3mm adaptor) and big
speakers (57mm of diameter). Comfortable enough to play for a few hours.

Miscellaneous
-------------

I like to study with **Dunlop .71mm** picks and **Ernie Ball Regular Slinky
10-46** strings.

Cables are all simple, blinded, handmade.

PIDSIM

Hi all,

Following the line of the previous post, I will talk about the projects I'll
stop maintaining for now. It's not a ``gentoo-x86`` package, but it's available
for Gentoo users anyway.

This post is about PIDSIM_, that was the base of my bachelor thesis. It is a
web-based PID controllers simulator, created with Python and some cool
libraries, like Matplotlib and the Flask framework.

I spent almost 3 years working on this project, and now I'm tired of it.
Actually I finished the stuff I wanted to implement and presented it to get my
degree.

You can see the application working here:

The software repositories are still available on my Mercurial server:

Gentoo users can install it from a specific overlay I created:

P.S.: Some time ago I heard some rumors that this project is being ported to
PHP by another student. The people who knows me well can imagine how "happy" I
became with this. It looks like I did a big effort to create something good
and they are just throwing away. I don't know if it's possible to port this
software to PHP, or if they will succeed, I don't care. The question is: 
"How they want to obtain progress on the research, if they rewrite things that
are already done instead of just extend them?" Anyway, I really don't care and
this thing is not my problem anymore.

Thanks.

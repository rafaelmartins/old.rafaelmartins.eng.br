.. _`Trac instance`: http://www.g-octave.org/

Since the last sunday I'm officially a `Gentoo developer`_ and one of
my first actions was move g-octave from the science overlay to the
main tree.

Now any Gentoo user will be able to install g-octave without using the
science overlay (but the ebuild is still marked as unstable). I hope
that this will increase the number of users testing it, and possibly
reporting issues.

I'm still using my `Trac instance`_ to receive bug reports, mainly because
my automated scripts are still depending on the Trac XMLRPC API.

You will still needs to use the science overlay if you want to install
the live version of g-octave, at least for now.

I hope you all enjoy and contribute!

Thanks!

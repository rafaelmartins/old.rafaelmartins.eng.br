Hi people!

I'm done with my work on the Google Summer of Code for this year
and I would like to thank to all the people that helped me during
the last 3 months.

Special thanks goes to my mentor (`Denis Dupeyron`_) by all the
friendship, support and the daily talks. I know that it was not
easy for him. ;)

I would also like to thank:

    - Sebastien Fabbro and all the people from ``#gentoo-science`` by the cool
      chat.
    - The Gentoo GSoC admin, `Donnie Berkholz`_, by the support.
    - `Brian Harring`_ and `Robin H. Johnson`_ by the help with the infrastructure.
    - All the people from the `Google Open Source Office`_, mainly the GSoC admin,
      `Carol Smith`_, by the support and the GSoC itself.
    - The `GNU Octave`_ developers by the great piece of software.
    - All the Gentoo_ community.

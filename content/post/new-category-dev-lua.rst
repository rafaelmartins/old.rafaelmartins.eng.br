Hi all,

last friday I moved all the Lua-related packages already on the main tree to
the just created dev-lua category. The package moves were smooth and the
things should be ok now.

I also added myself as co-maintainer of some of the packages and will
fix/update them soon.

I hope you all enjoy and contribute to the newest Gentoo package category. ;)

   help me to forcing the old creation date, instead of the date of the
   first commit on the new repository.

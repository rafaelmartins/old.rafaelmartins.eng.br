Octave 3.4.0 available on Gentoo
================================

.. tags: gentoo,octave

Hi all,

I updated the package *sci-mathematics/octave* to the version 3.4.0, released
a few days ago.

It seems all our old patches for 3.2.4 are applied on this version, and we have a
clean ebuild.

The new version is package.mask'ed for testing, because this is the first time I
touch this package and something **should** be broken :) . Please unmask it, test,
and `report the bugs`_.

.. _`report the bugs`: http://bugs.gentoo.org/

**Update**: octave-3.4.0 is already unmasked!

Thanks!

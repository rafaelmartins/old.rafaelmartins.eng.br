Yeah! I'll work for `Gentoo Linux`_ this summer (winter here in Brazil)!

My project for finish the development of g-octave_ was accepted, and I'll
be paid by Google to do this job as part of the `Google Summer of Code`_.
:o)

I would like to thanks to all the people involved from Gentoo, specially
Denis Dupeyron (my mentor) and SÃ©bastien Fabbro.

I also applied for another project: add the support for narrow cloning to the
Mercurial_ SCM. This feature would be very useful for all the people using
Mercurial_, but unfortunately I can work for only one project in the summer.

I would like to thanks to all the Mercurial_ community, that helped me when
I was trying to understand how Mercurial_ works internally and figuring out
a way of implementation to write my proposal. Special thanks goes to Peter
Arrenbrecht, Martin Geisler and Dirkjan Ochtman.

I have plans to work on this feature in the future, according with my
possibilities of time.

By the way, Mercurial_ will be with me in this summer yet, as my SCM of
choice for g-octave_. :)

Good luck for all us!

Thanks!

June 18
-------

 * Started the script to create the package database from SVN, using only the

   Not finished.

-------

 * More work on the SVN stuff


June 22

 * Did tests on the SVN script. Creation of source tarballs from SVN is done.
   Some improvements to the script are needed yet.


-------------------

That's all for now.


.. date added automatically by the script blohg_dump.py.
   this file was exported from an old repository, and this comment will
   help me to forcing the old creation date, instead of the date of the
   first commit on the new repository.

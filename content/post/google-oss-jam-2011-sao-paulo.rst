Last night I participated of the third edition of Google OSS Jam, that happened
at the offices of Google_ in São Paulo.

The event was very cool, and a nice opportunity to meet other people highly
interested in open source software and nerdy stuff.

This time I talked about my current GSoC project: `Distfile patching support`_
for Gentoo.

I was not so clear as I expected, but I think that people understood what I
*tried* to say. :)

Many thanks to `Rodolpho Eckhardt`_ and all the other Googlers behind this nice event.

Hi all,

following with the work to improve the Lua_ programing language on Gentoo,
I created an overlay_ where I'm working on the experimental stuff. Currently
I'm working to support the usage of LuaJIT_ as the main Lua implementation
(using an eselect module, that I'm writing as well). There's nothing ready for
usage yet, but the work is going fine.

After that, I'll work on the creation of ``lua.eclass`` (actually I already have
an eclass done, but it needs a major rewrite and improvements).

This process is pretty slow because I'm working alone and this is not my main
task as Gentoo developer. :(

Thanks.

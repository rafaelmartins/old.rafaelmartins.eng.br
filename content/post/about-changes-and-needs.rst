About changes and needs

   **Planet readers**: This is a long rant about personal stuff, that's partially
   related to technical stuff. Feel free to skip this entry if you are just
   interested on strictly technical topics.

I'm not used to write about my personal life here, but this time I need to write
up some things that are making me feel weird.

Everything is changing drastically in my life. I don't know if that's because the
real life issues started knocking on my door, or if I'm just getting old. The fact
is that some things that were unable to make me stop and think about them before
are now around my mind all the time.

I spend almost all my spare time working on Gentoo_ Linux these days. Although I'm
not doing anything extraordinary nor working on vital parts of the system, I
really like my work on Gentoo_ and do my best to keep the things in a good shape.

Despite what many people think, the Gentoo_ development isn't just about ebuilds
and software compilation. The interaction with other developers and with users
is one of the most important parts of the development. I really enjoy be in touch
with smart people from a lot of places around the world, and already made some
friends during this time.

I also spend some time working on some personal projects, like the `blogging engine`_
that moves this blog and `other projects`_. These projects are my playground, none
of them is widely used or "famous". I just work on them because I like. I can't
explain how happy I am when I get a patch for one of these projects. :o)

But when I start looking back I see that a lot of things I really need are
lacking in my life. Actually I think that my needs are changing with the time and
that's time to stop and refocus on what really matters.

I'm not saying that I'll kill my projects, or leave Gentoo_. No! But I can't keep
everything as is and ignore what I'm felling. It's time to start building things
by myself, and not just using compilers. Build things like a family, a professional
career, and not just binaries and libraries. :o)

I'm tired of seeing people with the same knowledge that I, or less, have better
opportunities than me, just because they tried, while I stood. Professionally and
personally, I'd say.

In a few days I'll be getting my engineering degree, but I thought my thesis was
undervalued. I also need to find a job and "start my life". Perhaps these are the
reasons I'm having these thoughts. I do not know.

Anyway, It's time to change!

Don't worry if you don't understand anything of this. I can't understand it too.
Go ahead, and forget what you read here. :o)

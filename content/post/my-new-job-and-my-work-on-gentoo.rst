My new job and my work on Gentoo
================================

.. tags: en-us,gentoo

It looks like my life is moving forward and I got a nice full-time position.
The bad part is that it isn't related to Gentoo, or even related to free
software development at all. That means I'm not going to have a lot of free
time to work on Gentoo stuff, for the coming months at least. Then I'll
define some "policies" to avoid me to retire from gentoo and to go crazy
overloaded with work:

- I'll not actively maintain any packages that are maintained by the herds
  that I'm member. These packages will still have nice maintainers from the
  herds.
- I'll actively maintain any packages where I'm explicitly listed as maintainer.
  e.g. my name is listed on ``metadata.xml``.

Since I left the university I stopped using a fair amount of the Gentoo
packages I maintain, then I'll also start dropping the maintainership of
these packages as soon as possible.

That's all that I can do for now. I hope you all understand and support me.

Feel free to consider this as the first step for the changes `I talked about a
few weeks ago </post/about-changes-and-needs/>`_. ;o)

Wish me luck, please!

Thanks.

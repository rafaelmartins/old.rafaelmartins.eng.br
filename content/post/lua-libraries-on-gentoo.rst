Hi all,

since before I became a Gentoo developer I'm planning to create
an overlay with packages for Lua_ libraries. Actually I already
worked a bit on it, but this thing is far from done. Some libraries
are tricky to pack properly due to some reasons that I'll discuss
in the future.

I would like to know how much the Gentoo community is interested
in this work and if some other developers are interested in join
me in this journey and maybe create a Lua_ project in a near future.

I'm waiting your contact_! ;)

Thanks!

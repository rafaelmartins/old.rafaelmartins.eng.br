LinuxCon Brazil 2010
====================

.. tags: en-us,events,gentoo

Hi folks,

last week I have been attending to the LinuxCon Brazil 2010, that was the first
edition of this event here in Brazil.

All the talks were pretty good and the event was a great oportunity to meet nice
people, good projects and learn some cool stuff (and get an `autograph of Linus
Torvalds`_ as well :)

.. _`autograph of Linus Torvalds`: http://files.rafaelmartins.eng.br/img/autograph_linus.jpg

Unfortunately the Gentoo presence in the event was null. Well, not really null
because I was there, but it seems that the Brazilian users are not very
interested in Gentoo and I'm not sure if someone will be able to change this
some day.

Maybe I'll write more stuff about the LinuxCon soon.

Stay tuned! ;)

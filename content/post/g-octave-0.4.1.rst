[ANN] g-octave 0.4.1
====================

.. tags: en-us,gentoo,g-octave

.. _`#340577`: http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=340577

I just released g-octave 0.4.1, that is a bug fix release. This version fixes
the bug `#340577`_ and some issues with the script ``manage_pkgdb.py``.

Additionally, this release comes with an updated package database. The
new packages are:

- dataframe-0.4
- dataframe-0.5
- nan-2.3.0
- nan-2.3.1
- nurbs-1.3.1
- tsa-4.1.0
- fits-1.0.0
- general-1.2.2
- io-1.0.13
- parallel-2.0.2
- parallel-2.0.4

The ebuild is already available on the Gentoo main tree (a.k.a. Portage tree)
and updated documentation can be found here:

http://doc.g-octave.org/0.4.1/

Please test it! :)

Thanks!

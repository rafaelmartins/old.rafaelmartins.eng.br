Moving my stuff back to Mercurial
=================================

.. tags: gentoo,g-octave,mercurial,git

I moved all my repositories (Gentoo-related repositories included)
from Git_ to Mercurial_. Actually only a few repositories were using Git_,
some of them due to Gentoo infrastructure restrictions, but I decided to host
my projects myself right now (or at least until `bug #350461`_ be fixed).

As Mercurial_ is also a DVCS_, people will be able to copy my sourcecodeand
host anywhere if needed, and my projects will not die, even if I die tomorrow.

.. _Git: http://git-scm.com/
.. _Mercurial: http://mercurial.selenic.com/
.. _`bug #350461`: http://bugs.gentoo.org/350461
.. _DVCS: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_revision_control

So here are the hgweb instances that I'm running currently:

- http://hg.rafaelmartins.eng.br/
- http://hg.g-octave.org/

Thanks!

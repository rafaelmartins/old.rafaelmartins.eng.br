Server down for maintenance
===========================

.. tags: gentoo,vps,walrus

Hi all,

I just want to let you all know that this box (walrus.rafaelmartins.com),
that hosts this blog and other services, was down during almost all the last
day (Nov 17), and that almost all the services are still down right now due
to an operating system reinstallation (Gentoo, of course) and a major cleanup.
Actually just the blog is working right now.

If you are trying to use some service, like my Gentoo overlay, please be patient ;)

Thanks.

blohg, A Mercurial based blogging engine
========================================

.. tags: en-us,blohg,gentoo

Hi all,

The more detail-oriented people may have noticed that this blog runs on a
different blog engine, called blohg_, that's developed by myself. I'm
developing it for some time already, but it's the first time that I'm talking
about it here.

It's my pet project, that I do for fun when I'm annoyed with the real world
issues, and wasn't created to be distributed. This situation changed a bit
during the last months and now it have a few users, a website
(http://blohg.org/), and is distributed in the `Python Package index`_
(http://pypi.python.org/pypi/blohg) and Gentoo_ (`www-apps/blohg`_).

It uses Mercurial_ to store and manage the blog content, and reStructuredText_
as markup language. There's also some cool features implemented. Take a look at
the official documentation here:

http://docs.blohg.org/

If you like Mercurial_ and want something new for your blog, give blohg_ a try.

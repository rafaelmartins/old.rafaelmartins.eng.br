GSoC and Scrum
==============

.. tags: en-us,gentoo,gsoc

This year I helped the Gentoo GSoC project as a mentor for the first time! I
mentored Jauhien Piatlicki, that worked on the g-sorcery project, that is a
framework for automated ebuild generators. It is meant to replace g-octave
and some of the other Gentoo automated ebuild generators in the future.

I have been using Scrum at work for some time already, and asked Jauhien about
trying to use it in our project. We agreed on using it wherever it made sense
for our workflow. In other words, we adapted Scrum to our workflow, instead of
adapt our workflow to Scrum. That's because none of us was a Scrum expert, and
because we needed to follow Gentoo/Google guidelines and timeline during all
the project, making it hard to apply some aspects of the Scrum methodologies.

We had sprints of 2 weeks, starting at monday, after a quick planning on IRC.
We had a private IRC channel at Freenode, where we discussed stuff, had
meetings, etc.

We didn't had daily meetings. We were on very different timezones, and it was
quite hard to meet daily. We just used the other tools and our IRC channel to
fill the gap left by the daily meetings.

We created a kanban board, using Trello_:

This board and the IRC channel were our main management tools, and both worked
pretty well. The board cards were used for stories and the card checklists were
used for the tasks.

During the first planning meeting we estimated all the backlog, to know how
many points were required per sprint to keep the project on schedule, because we
had a hard timeline to accomplish. These estimatives were quite useful, because
everybody following the project was able to know if the work was evolving
properly or not. But estimating the backlog, to accomplish a timeline, isn't an
easy task, it requires good knowledge of the stories and about how everything
will be implemented.

During the other planning meetings we just calculated how many points were
done in the previous sprint and choose stories for the next sprint, replacing the
stories already finished. I let Jauhien choose the stories he wanted to include
in the sprints.

Our methodology was proven efficient right before the GSoC mid-term evaluation.
All the stories planned to be finished before the evaluation were done, showing
that the work was evolving like planned and that our estimatives were good enough.
We were already confident on this, because all the sprints before the evaluation
were finished in time. :)

Same thing before the final evaluation. All the required stories were finished!

We both had several problems during the project, but the tools made it easy to track
the current state of the project easily by looking at the kanban board, at the
source repository or just asking on IRC. Knowing the status of the project allowed
us to focus the efforts on getting the tasks done, while still handling our personal
problems in parallel.

This post isn't intended to be a Scrum tutorial or something like that. I just
wanted to share the experience of using these methodologies during a GSoC project.
We just adapted Scrum to our workflow, as said before. Don't be too picky! :)

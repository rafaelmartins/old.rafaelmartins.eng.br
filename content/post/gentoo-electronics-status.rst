Although I'm relatively busy with my work to improve `Lua on Gentoo`_ I need to
update you about my main role: sci-electronics. Actually, the Gentoo Electronics
subproject right now.

On October 17 the developers from the sci-electronics herd had a meeting to
discuss the state of the herd and the creation of a subproject. At the end of
the meeting I was elected the lead of this subproject, and now I should stop
slacking and start doing something to make the "Soldering Iron Brotherhood"
move ahead.

The `subproject page`_ was created by me, based on a work of Denis (Calchan),
with some help of Thomas (TomJBE) and is already online (not listed on the
Science page because its not done yet):

Currently we have 2 main tasks:

- Recruit new developers: We need more developers to take care of the
  electronics-related stuff. New blood is never enough. ;) I still can't
  mentoring anyone to join Gentoo as developer, but I'm sure that some senior
  developer will be glad to help you join the team if you are really interested.

- Write test benches: Electronics software is kinda esoteric. Arch testers
  usually are not specialists, then we should provide good test benches to
  make their life easier when stabilizing our packages.

That's all for now.

Feel free to contact me and stay tuned! :)

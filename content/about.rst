My name is Rafael Goncalves Martins. I'm a Control and Automation engineer,
programmer and open-source developer.

I'm currently working for `Titans Group`_, as Software Architect.

I spend almost all my free time playing with open-source stuff. The main
projects I'm working on are `Gentoo Linux`_ and blohg_.

On the personal-side, I'm a 24 years old guy, single, living at SÃ£o Paulo/SP,
Brazil.
